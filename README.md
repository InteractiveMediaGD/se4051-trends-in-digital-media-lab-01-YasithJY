## FAQ

### 1. What is gaze-based interaction?
It is a hands-free input method where the system uses the user's focus (visual attention) as a cursor to interact with objects.

### 2. Why is dwell time useful?
It prevents accidental triggers (the "Midas Touch" problem) by making sure the user intended to select the object by staring at it for a set time.

### 3. How does sensory feedback improve realism?
It mimics real-world reactions. Using sound and visuals together confirms the interaction worked, which increases the user's feeling of "presence."

### 4. Which cube felt most immersive and why?
Cube 3 (color + scale + sound). It uses multiple senses simultaneously, making the virtual environment feel more reactive and "real."
